What is Inheritance?
- It is a mechanism where a class inherits the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class, known as the superclass or parent class.
- The class that inherits from the superclass is called the subclass or child class.


Why And When To Use "Inheritance"?
- Code Reusability (fields and methods)
- Method Overriding
- Polymorphism
- Hierarchical Organization


Notes:
- final class cannot inherit.
- java does not support multiple inheritance.
- java support supports multiple inheritance.
